As an aternative to set up a webhook, a bot updates can be fetched by periodically polling Telegram APIs

> [!WARNING]
> Manual updates polling is not available if a webhook is set up for the bot. Webhook should be remove first using its [unregisterWebhook](3.deleting-webhooks.md) method


in order to get the updates, an [`->updates()`](/docs/14.models/1.telegraph-bot.md#updates) method is available in the [TelegraphBot](/docs/14.models/1.telegraph-bot.md) model:

```php
$updates = $telegraphBot->updates();
```

the call will result in a collection of [`DefStudio\Telegraph\DTO\TelegramUpdate`](/docs/12.features/9.dto.md#telegram-update) instances, one for each update, sorted by the oldest one.

It is advised to keep track of the `TelegramUpdate::id()` in order to avoid processing the same update multiple times.

The content of each update depends on the update type ([Chat Message](4.webhook-request-types.md#chat-messages) or [Callback Query](4.webhook-request-types.md#callback-queries)) and on the specific message type. Refer to the [DTO](/docs/12.features/9.dto.md) section for more details.
