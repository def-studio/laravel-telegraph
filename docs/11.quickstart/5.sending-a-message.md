After a bot and at least one chat have been set up, this package can be used to post new messages:

```php
use DefStudio\Telegraph\Models\TelegraphChat;

/** @var TelegraphChat $chat */

$chat->html("<strong>Hello!</strong>\n\nI'm here!")->send();
```

![](/docs/img/screenshots/first-message.png)

as an alternative, messages can be formatted with markdown:

```php
$chat->markdown("*Hello!*\n\nI'm here!")->send();
```

or markdownV2:

```php
$chat->markdownV2("*Hello!*\n\nI'm here!")->send();
```
