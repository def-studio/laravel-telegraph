A keyboard can be added to a message in order to offer a set of options to the user:

## Attaching a keyboard

A keyboard can be added to a message using the `->keyboard()` command, passing a new `Keyboard` object as argument.

`Keyboard` has a fluent way to define its buttons and other properties (rows, button chunking, etc.):

buttons can be set up using the `Keyboard::make()->buttons()` method and are defined as a `Button` array

```php
use DefStudio\Telegraph\Keyboard\Button;
use DefStudio\Telegraph\Keyboard\Keyboard;

Telegraph::message('hello world')
->keyboard(Keyboard::make()->buttons([
        Button::make('Delete')->action('delete')->param('id', '42'),
        Button::make('open')->url('https://test.it'),
        Button::make('Web App')->webApp('https://web-app.test.it'),
        Button::make('Login Url')->loginUrl('https://loginUrl.test.it'),
]))->send();
```

Additionally, a keyboard can be added to a message using a closure:

```php
use DefStudio\Telegraph\Keyboard\Keyboard;

Telegraph::message('hello world')
->keyboard(function(Keyboard $keyboard){
    return $keyboard
        ->button('Delete')->action('delete')->param('id', '42')
        ->button('open')->url('https://test.it')
        ->button('Web App')->webApp('https://web-app.test.it')
        ->button('Login Url')->loginUrl('https://loginUrl.test.it');
})->send();
```

## Buttons

Each `Button` can be defined using its fluent methods and can be of three types:

### Callback Buttons

Define an `action` and some `params`. They triggers a **callback query** to be handled by a custom webhook

```php
Button::make('Delete')->action('delete')->param('id', '42'),
```

### URL Buttons

Define an `url` and are used to open an external url when pressed:

```php
Button::make('open')->url('https://test.it'),
```

### Web App Buttons

Declare the web app `url` and are used to start a telegram bot [Web App](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps) :

```php
Button::make('open')->webApp('https://webapp.url.dev'),
```

### Login Url Buttons

Declare the login `url` and are used to start a telegram widget [Login Url](https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login) :

```php
Button::make('open')->loginUrl('https://login.url.dev'),
```

### Switch Inline Query Buttons

Pressing the button will prompt the user to select one of their chats,
open that chat and insert the bot's username and the specified inline query
in the input field. The query text may be empty, in which case just the
bot's username will be inserted. (see `switch_inline_query` in [Telegram Bot docs](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinekeyboardbutton) for reference)


```php
Button::make('switch')->switchInlineQuery('foo'),
```

Additionally, an inline query button may act for the current chat
(so, would skip the destination chat prompt) only if `->currentChat()` method is added
(see `switch_inline_query_current_chat` in [Telegram Bot docs](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinekeyboardbutton) for reference)

```php
Button::make('switch')->switchInlineQuery('foo')->currentChat(),
```


## Keyboard Rows

A keyboard will normally place one button per row, this behaviour can be customized by defining rows, by setting individual buttons width or by chunking buttons

### by rows

```php
use DefStudio\Telegraph\Keyboard\Button;
use DefStudio\Telegraph\Keyboard\Keyboard;

$keyboard = Keyboard::make()
    ->row([
        Button::make('Delete')->action('delete')->param('id', '42'),
        Button::make('Dismiss')->action('dismiss')->param('id', '42'),
    ])
    ->row([
        Button::make('open')->url('https://test.it'),
    ]);
```

### by setting buttons width

A button relative width can be set using a float number the total width percentage to be taken. Buttons will flow through the rows according to their width

this example would define two buttons on the first row and a large button on the second one:

```php
use DefStudio\Telegraph\Keyboard\Keyboard;

$keyboard = Keyboard::make()
    ->button('Delete')->action('delete')->param('id', '42')->width(0.5)
    ->button('Dismiss')->action('dismiss')->param('id', '42')->width(0.5)
    ->button('open')->url('https://test.it');
    ->button('open')->webApp('https://web-app.url.dev');
    ->button('open')->loginUrl('https://login.url.dev');
```

> [!NOTE]
> - A button default width is 1 (that's to say, the entire row width)
> - Each width is defined as a float between 0 and 1 that represents the floating point percentage of the row taken by the button
> - Each button will fill the current row or flow in the subsequent one if there isn't enough space left


### by chunking

Buttons can be authomatically chunked in rows using the `->chunk()` method.

This example would return a first row of two buttons, a second row of two buttons and the last row with the remaining button.

```php
use DefStudio\Telegraph\Keyboard\Keyboard;

$keyboard = Keyboard::make()
    ->button('Delete')->action('delete')->param('id', '42')
    ->button('Dismiss')->action('dismiss')->param('id', '42')
    ->button('Share')->action('share')->param('id', '42')
    ->button('Solve')->action('solve')->param('id', '42')
    ->button('Open')->url('https://test.it')
    ->chunk(2);
```

## Updating a keyboard

A message keyboard can be replaced by a new one by submitting its `messageId`:

```php
Telegraph::replaceKeyboard(
    messageId: 1568794, 
    newKeyboard: Keyboard::make()->buttons([
        Button::make('Delete')->action('delete')->param('id', '42'),
        Button::make('open')->url('https://test.it'),
    ])
)->send();
```

## Deleting a keyboard

A keyboard can be removed from a message by submitting its `messageId`:

```php
Telegraph::deleteKeyboard(messageId: 1568794)->send();
```

## Conditional methods

a `when` method allows to execute a closure when the given condition is verified

```php
Keyboard::make()
    ->button('Dismiss')->action('dismiss')->param('id', '42')->width(0.5)
    ->when($userCanDelete, fn(Keyboard $keyboard) => $keyboard->button('Delete')->action('delete')->param('id', '42')->width(0.5))
```

## Right to left layout

A `rightToLeft` method allows to change buttons layout from left-to-right to right-to-left (RTL).

```php
use DefStudio\Telegraph\Keyboard\Button;
use DefStudio\Telegraph\Keyboard\Keyboard;

$keyboard = Keyboard::make()
    ->row([
        Button::make('Delete')->action('delete')->param('id', '42'),
        Button::make('Dismiss')->action('dismiss')->param('id', '42'),
    ])
    ->row([
        Button::make('open')->url('https://test.it'),
    ])
    ->rightToLeft();
```
