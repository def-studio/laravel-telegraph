### Join groups permission

To allow the bot to join Telegram groups, use the `/setjoingroups` command in @BotFather:

### Privacy
Now you need to choose how much the bot will be able to read from the chats. Send `/setprivacy` command to @BotFather, and select your bot privacy:

- **enable**: to handle only `/` commands handling
- **disable**: to allow the bot to read all messages sent to the chat
